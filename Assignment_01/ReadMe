I am using my own set of classes, fields, methods, here to lay the foundation for the game,
according to my thinking pattern and assignment 01, my only concern is game rules.


flogschema package:

   defines game rules, scoring machanism

enum Consonants: represent consonants
enum Vowels: represents vowels
enum PenaltyOptions: represent damage ratios give to every weakest player based on the option
                     they selected out of 3 options.
FlogGame class: 
                 used as a parent class in hierachy, will place common methods, fields that are common
                 sub classes here with more implementation and architecture improvement.



class LetterBag extends FlogGame
	
	
	public char[] give10letters()
					
		
	public void simulateScrabbleLetterBag()
		simulate scrabble letter bag
		
	public void replicateLetter()

public class WordBag extends LetterBag:


	public void buildWordBag()		
		 initialization the tree with local dictionary file
	
	public boolean verifyFirstTwoLetters()	
		traverse the tree with first 2 characters in-order to find whether there are valid words
		
	public boolean isCompleteWord(char[] word)
		check whether the input word is valid complete word.
		
	
	public char[] findLongestWord(char[] currentCharSequence)

	public boolean verifyInputWord(char[] inputWord)	
		 verify word existence
	
	public String[] searchForSimilarWords(char[] suppliedCharacters)		
		search for similar words according to current letters
		used as a caching machanism and many more


public class WordBoard extends WordBag:
	
	public void initialSetup():
		initialize the board with first 2 letters, user 10 letters, powers(multiply letter value if placed on it)

	
	public void placePowersOnTheWordBoard()
		place powers randomly on the board
		
	public void placeFirst2Letters()
		place first 2 letters on the board
		
	public int[][][] randomizePowerPositions()
		 ex: a[1] ={10, 15, 2} // row, column, power
		place powers randomly on the board		
		
	public char findPlacedLetterDirection()
		find whether the words are place horizontally or vertically
		
	public void searchForWordsHorizontally(char[] newlyPlacedCharacters)
		search for words on the board in horizontal way
	
	public void searchForWordsVertically(char[] newlyPlacedCharacters)
		search for words on the board in vertical way
		
	public int letterCount()
		count number of letters to give length bonus and etc
	
	public void setFirst2LetterPositon()
		random position first 2 letters, but limited to center of the board
		
		

public class Scorer extends WordBag 


	public static boolean isRoundEnd()
		check whether the round is end: check whether there is not more positions to place letters,
		or no valid words


	public static void setRoundEnd(boolean roundEnd)

	public void calculateRoundScore()
		calculate the round score for all players including weakest players 
	
	public double calculatePenalty(int selectedPenaltyOption) 
		calculate penalty based on the option choosed

	public double calculateScoreForValidWord()
		calculate partial words and 12 letter words
		
	public double calculate12LetterWordScore()
		calculate score for 12 letter words
		
	public double calculatePartialWord() 
		use enum Consonants and enum Vowel values to calculate
		partial word score
			
	public void addPowerBonus()
		calculate power bonus by moving along the 3D array
		
	
	public double[] randomizePaneltyOptions()
		shuffling the penalty options, give to weakest players
		 using random numbers
		
	
	public void addWordLengthBonus()	
		/* calculate word length bonu  
		* by moving along the 3D array
		*/
	


	public void checkForHighestScore()
		check for high scores with db, and other player scores
